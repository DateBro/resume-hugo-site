Iâ€™m a 1st-year CS Master student at McMaster University, Canada and received my CS Bachelor's degree from Shandong University, China. Currently I am looking for a SDE/SWE coop/internship position starting from Summer/May 2023.

As a CS student exploring the world of computer science and engineering for over five years, I have solid foundation of theoretical knowledge as well as strong object-oriented programming skills. Diverse experience in research and industry brought me a broader understanding of engineering, along with strong analytical, problem-solving, and teamwork abilities. Through hands-on projects, I found transferring innovative ideas and solutions to real life with codes is truly enjoyable. I am always keeping fresh and passionate about new technology and knowledge, and as a fast learner, I can grasp them quickly and leverage them effectively into work processes. In addition, planning goals well in advance and organizing tasks in an orderly way make me a goal-oriented performer with time management sense.
